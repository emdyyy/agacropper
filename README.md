This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Main purpose

It solves a common problem, that painters have. When customers send them pictures as reference, they need to resize and crop it before being able to print it out. This process is not so easy for many especially, when they don't have much experience with computers. Therefore this project was born. It simplifies the process of uploading and resizing the image and enables easy print-ready file of the manipulated image.
